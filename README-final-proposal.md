### Capstone Project Final Idea

#### What is the problem you want to solve?
How have helpful reviews (>8/10) changed over time?

- Comparing review length over time 
- Comparing review rating over time


#### Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? 
(In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldn’t have otherwise?)

- Multiple studies have found that consumers are increasingly reliant upon online reviews when making decisions regarding purchase. According to [Entrepreneur](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/253361), industry experts expect further increase in coming years.
- Amazon has recognised that review helpfulness is a good indicator for bringing certain reviews up to the 'Top'. This has shifted away from chronologically sorting reviews according to 'Recent' posts or 'Highest Ratings'. 
- By giving greater weight to "legitimate" reviews, the product will likely be given a more accurate picture, as opposed to fake or unhelpful reviews.
- Reviews are a source of valuable market intelligence. Customers rely on it, and merchants use feedback to make strategic placement decisions.

#### In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem 
(know that this might change later)

- Data Cleaning and Wrangling
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Descriptive statistics and visualisations
- Data story and further analysis
- Lastly, final result covering requirements listed in the deliverables below

####What are your deliverables? 
1. **Code** for the project documented on github.
2. **A final paper** explaining the problem, approach and findings (+ ideas for further research, and three concrete recommendations for client on how to use my findings).
3. **A slide deck** for Springboard’s technical blog. 


*Note: All code and further documentation you write will be added to this repository.*
*Once your mentor has approved your proposal, please share the github repository URL on the community and ask for feedback*
