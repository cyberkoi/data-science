### Capstone Project Final Idea

#### What is the problem you want to solve?
- Reviewers who give >50 reviews across the dataset and their characteristics
- E.g., what cateogies these reviews target; helpfulness vs score


What factors make a review helpful?

#### Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? 
In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldn’t have otherwise?



#### What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?

#### In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem 
(know that this might change later)

- Data Cleaning and Wrangling
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Descriptive statistics and visualisations
- Data story and further analysis
- Lastly, final result covering requirements listed in the deliverables below



####What are your deliverables? 
1. **Code** for the project documented on github.
2. **A final paper** explaining the problem, approach and findings (+ ideas for further research, and three concrete recommendations for client on how to use my findings).
3. **A slide deck** for Springboard’s technical blog. 


*Note: All code and further documentation you write will be added to this repository.*
*Once your mentor has approved your proposal, please share the github repository URL on the community and ask for feedback*
