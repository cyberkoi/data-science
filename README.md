### Capstone project proposal - initial ideas

This document lists four ideas that could potentially become my final capstone project. The plan is to choose one of these three ideas to focus on first, before diving further into the intricacies (methods, techniques etc.) that the final project demands.

## Entree Chicago Recommendation Data
- Abstract: This data contains a record of user interactions with the Entree Chicago restaurant recommendation system. This is an interactive system that recommends restaurants to the user based on factors such as cuisine, price, style, atmosphere, etc. or based on similarity to a restaurant in another city (e.g. find me a restaurant similar to the Patina in Los Angeles). The user can then provide feedback such as find a nicer or less expensive restaurant.
- What I can do: Find out which factor is of greatest concern to users (price, cuisine, etc.)?

## Walmat Store Sales Forecasting
- Abstract: This data contains a record of historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains a number of departments.

## World Trade
- Abstract: Trade is a key means to fight poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals, specifically by improving developing country access to markets, and supporting a rules based, predictable trading system. In cooperation with other international development partners, the World Bank launched the Transparency in Trade Initiative to provide free and easy access to data on country-specific trade policies.
